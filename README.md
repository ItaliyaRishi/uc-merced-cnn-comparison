# uc-merced-cnn-comparison
This project compares the performance of advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — AlexNet, VGG19, ResNet50, and LeNet-5 — on the UC Merced Land Use Dataset for image classification. The goal is to evaluate their training behavior, validation accuracy, and generalization ability using standardized metrics and visualizations.
