# uc-merced-cnn-comparison
This project compares the performance of advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ‚Äî AlexNet, VGG19, ResNet50, and LeNet-5 ‚Äî on the UC Merced Land Use Dataset for image classification. The goal is to evaluate their training behavior, validation accuracy, and generalization ability using standardized metrics and visualizations.
# üåç CNN Model Comparison on UC Merced Land Use Dataset

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/uc-merced-cnn-comparison.git
cd uc-merced-cnn-comparison
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Train a model:

```bash
python main.py --model resnet50
```

You can change `resnet50` to `alexnet`, `vgg19`, or `lenet5`.

## üîç Grad-CAM Visualization

Class activation maps (Grad-CAM) are implemented for visualizing what parts of the image the model focuses on during classification. Check `utils/gradcam.py`.
